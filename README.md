- [Flows in Networks](./1-Flows-In-Network): 
    - **Evacuation**: Applying an algorithm for finding maximum flow in a network to determine how fast people can be evacuated from the given city.
    - **Airline Crew**: Applying an algorithm for finding maximum matching in a bipartite graph to assign airline crews to flights in the most efficient way.
    - **Stock Charts**: Applying a flow algorithm approach to find the minimum Path Cover in a DAG to compute the maximum number of stock charts that do not intersect.
- [Linear Programming](./2-Linear-Programming):
    - **Energy values**: Applying Gaussian elimination to solve a problem where we have to tell the amount of nutrients that each ingredient has.
